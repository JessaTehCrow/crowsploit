# Introduction

**Crowsploit** is a modular tool dedicated to allowing the end-user to dictate how to use the tool. This is done through a modular settings file much alike the .bashrc you would see in linux. As well as giving the end-user kernel access using the command API.
This means that the user can create their own scripts with built-in error handling, argument parsing, and system control with little to no effort.
