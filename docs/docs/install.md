# Installation

## In game
!!! warning
    This method only works for multiplayer, and does not work on single player.

1. Visit `www.crowsploit.net` in the ingame browser, and go to the `shop` tab.
2. Locate and download `crowsploit` to your local system.
3. Launch `crowsploit` with the arguments `setup` to setup your system for crowsploit. (Make sure you run this as root)
4. Buy `system` and `exploit` from the shop, and move both of these to the `/etc/crow/tools` folder
5. Launch crowsploit as any user and you have access to the tool

!!! warning
    Running crowsploit as guest or normal user does mean that you cannot store new exploits since you need root access to write them
